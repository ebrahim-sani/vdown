                     to liquidated damages of ten thousand dollars ($15,569). If
                     your violation results in legal action or causes physical
                     or emotional harm to any party, you will be subject to
                     liquidated damages of One Hundred and Fifty Thousand

                     been affected by your actions. These liquidated damages are
                     not intended to be punitive, but instead are a reasonable
                     estimate of the actual damages that may result from such a
                     violation. It is important to note that these liquidated
                     damages represent a minimum amount and you will be held
                     liable for any actual damages that exceed this amount. In

                     damages to be unenforceable, the amount will be lowered
                     only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

            <strong>13. Disputes</strong>
            <br />
            <p>
               a. These Terms, and any dispute between you and us, are subject
               to the laws of the Russian Federation, without considering
               conflicts of law principles. YOU AGREE TO THE PERSONAL AND
               EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IN THE COURTS OF the Russian Federation.
               However, if we are seeking indemnification from you, we may file
               a lawsuit for indemnification in the same court where the claim
               against us is brought. YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO SEEK A DIFFERENT
               VENUE DUE TO IMPROPER OR INCONVENIENT FORUM.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
               b. By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree that any
               claims or disputes must be brought solely in your individual
               capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported
               class or representative action.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
               c. As part of these terms, you agree to waive any right to a
               trial by jury for any dispute between us related to these terms
               or the Service. This provision remains valid even if any other
               provisions in this section are waived, including arbitration
               provisions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <strong>14. General Terms</strong>
            <br />
            <p>
               a. These Terms, which may be updated periodically, represent the
               full agreement between you and us, replacing all previous
               agreements between us, and cannot be altered without our written
               approval.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
               b. If we do not enforce any of these Terms, it does not mean that
               we are giving up any rights or provisions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
               c. If any portion of these Terms is deemed invalid or
               unenforceable by a court of law, the invalid or unenforceable
               portion shall be replaced with a valid and enforceable provision
               that closely reflects the intention of the original provision.
               The remaining terms of the agreement shall remain in full force
               and effect.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
               d. This agreement does not aim to grant any rights or remedies to
               any third party.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
               e. You cannot assign, transfer, or sublicense these Terms without
               our prior written consent, but we can assign or transfer them
               without any restrictions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
               f. In the event that this agreement is translated into a language
               other than English and there is a discrepancy between the
               translation and the English version, the English version will
               take precedence.
